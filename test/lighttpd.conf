# A lighttpd config file for Domoticz, serving the UI as Static content and proying only API calls to Domoticz
#
# Make sure you set the Document-root to your full-path of the Domoticz WWW directory
#
# All calls to 'json.htm' will be proxied to the Domoticz webserver/webservice that is expected to run on port 8080 (No SSL)
# You can start Domoticz for example with the following config
# sudo ./bin/domoticz -www 8080 -wwwroot www -loglevel debug,error -debuglevel webserver
#
# Domoticz will show the (web)requests it handles (should be the json.htm ones only)
# And you can tail the lighttpd logfile (/tmp/lighttpd.log) to see all other static requests being handled by lighttpd
